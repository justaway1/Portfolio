<h1>Hero Section</h1>

I am really proud of how the Hero come up to be. It may be **simple** and **easy** to some,
but personally for me that was my first real project!

It was tricky at first with the alignment and the proper **width** and **height**!

<h1>Work Section</h1>

Here you can find all of my current projects, it will be added more in the **future.**

The **big background text** has eaten alot of time just to finalize his **position** and **height**!

The list items of has a nice overlay hover effect, struggled at first with the proper positions and the expanding of the overlay!

<h1>Contact</h1>

A simple contact form that has no value, I am planning on addding some form submit in the near future.
Currently it is an empty #shell.
